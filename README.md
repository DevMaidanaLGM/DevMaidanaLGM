## Development Experience

I've been coding since went to university, I made full CRUD systems learning and using different paradigms, frameworks, technologies, languages, and techniques in there. Besides, I took some online courses, a bootcamp and I was coding as a freelancer to improve this knowledge and adquire some more experience. Last think I learned is React Native using Expo (Mobile development is not my strong area, but it was the need of a client).

I want to specialise myself on C# .NET, so I search for jobs in that area. I'm looking for a team I can learn from and grow up profesionally.

You can find my projects at my portfolio. 

These are some of the projects I can't upload in there for different reasons.
